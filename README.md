Open Source Solar Spectrum Project
==================================

The goal for this Open Source Solar Spectrum Analyzer was to collaboratively design the mechanical and electronic controls for a direct/diffuse data acquisition of wavelength and tilt angle dependent solar flux.

Making it Go
------------

You'll need some libraries.

* AFMotor: http://www.ladyada.net/make/mshield/download.html
* Chronodot: http://planetstephanie.net/2011/04/09/chronodot-library-for-arduino/

They have also been included in this project for convenience.

For a refresher on how to install them, take a look at the Contributed Libraries section of http://arduino.cc/it/Reference/Libraries.
